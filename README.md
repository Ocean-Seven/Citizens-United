# Citizens-United

### About
Citizens United is a web app that bridges tech into the community by connecting volunteers with individuals that require assistance with day-to-day activities (senior citizens, single-mothers, etc.) around the Los Angeles area. The app allows users to to sign up as either a volunteer or a requester and displays ggregates disparate sources of lost dog data and displays it on a single page so that owners don't have to search across multiple websites. Additionally, the app helps finders of lost dogs connect with their owners.

A user first selects whether they have either lost or found a dog, and then is presented with an up-to-date list of dogs matching their particular search. The user is then able to filter the results by location and description. If a user finds a match, they are able to contact the original poster and/or share a "flyer" via Facebook.

Lost and Found also has its own database where users can post both lost and found dogs which will be included in the search results.
