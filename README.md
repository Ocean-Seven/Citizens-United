# Citizens-United

### Introduction
This project was a brief 1.5 week sprint where our team (Blue Ocean) completed an MVP for our external client, Victor. The goal was to create a web app that bridges tech and the local community by connecting volunteers with individuals that require assistance with day-to-day activities (e.g. aiding senior citizens to get groceries) around the Los Angeles area.

### App Functionality
Citizens United was built because our client saw a need for a safe and easy-to-use medium for senior citizens to request help with simple daily tasks. The app allows a user to to sign up as either a volunteer or an individual that requires assistance. On sign-up, our app stores our user's information in our secure MongoDB database. Individuals that request assistance ("requestor") can submit a task request in a neighborhood of his or her choosing at a specified date and time. A requester is able to filter by a neighborhood and a task duration and "accept" or "hide" tasks. Once accepted, both users will have the ability to enter a chatroom, which displays the task information, requester information, volunteer information, a map overview of the location to meet at, and real-time chat feature.
